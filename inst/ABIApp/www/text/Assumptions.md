1.	The application only accounts for genetic distances to determine species boundaries and a simple phylogeny. It does not use other information such as morphological characters or biological information to determine taxonomic boundaries.

2.	The genetic distances obtained from Chan et al. (2021) were mined from the NCBI database and only covers helminth species that are available in the database(5). 

3.	The data obtained assumes that the species identity for the sequences are correct based on the information from the NCBI database.

4.	Recommendations on further steps to take are subjective and should be dependent on the aim of the user. The recommendations in the application are based on the results obtained from the queried genetic distance, the utility and limitations for helminth molecular-based studies from the authors’ comparison of genetic markers, and the authors’ opinions.
