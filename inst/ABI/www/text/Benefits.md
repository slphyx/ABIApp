The ABIapp is a convenient and easy to use application, as it only requires basic bioinformatics. Users will just be required to input their aligned FASTA file (with their query taxa) or a genetic distance value obtained from their taxon of interest from the three groups of helminths. The queried genetic distance value for the taxon of interest (against a reference) will then be compared to the database of estimated cut-off genetic distance, and the user will be able to know which taxonomic hierarchy level the queried taxon falls into. Additionally, the database of estimated cut-off genetic distance values for the application were obtained from existing helminth reference sequences, enabling high classification accuracy as the estimated genetic distance values are targeted for helminths.
