####  Before you start: 

1.	Species or groups of helminths should be identified by morphological characters at the beginning. However, if the specimens are unidentifiable due to incomplete morphological characters, biological or clinical data can be used to determine probable helminth groups.

2.	The user must have either an aligned FASTA file (containing the queried sequence) or a pairwise genetic value obtained from one of ten molecular genetic markers to use the application. **Please note that the FASTA file should not exceed 2MB in size.**

3.	If a FASTA file is used, the aligned FASTA file should contain less than 20 sequences, and the taxa should be in the selected helminth group of the queried taxon. Multiple sequence alignment can be conducted prior by using a user-friendly program such as ClustalX.

4.	If a genetic distance value is used, genetic distances can be calculated prior by selecting approximately 3-5 similar species for sequence analysis. The pairwise distances can be analyzed using a user-friendly phylogenetics program, such as MEGA.
